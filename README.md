Likes determine your your TL, each like adds the respective tweet's category as an interest in your twitter settings under interests, this determines what populates on your TL.
This javascript code automates having to manually uncheck each box. I might automate the whole thing using puppeteer, idk.

# Steps
1. Go to https://x.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests
2. Copy the javascript code from x_interests_fix.js
3. Open console
4. Paste and run code
